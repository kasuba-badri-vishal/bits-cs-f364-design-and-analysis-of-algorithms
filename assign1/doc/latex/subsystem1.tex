When a directed graph vertices both reach each other then they are called strongly connected components.\hypertarget{subsystem1_subsystem1section2}{}\doxysection{Section 2}\label{subsystem1_subsystem1section2}
\mbox{\hyperlink{class_graph}{Graph}} is basically a collection of vertices with connections\hypertarget{subsystem1_subsystem1subsection1}{}\doxysubsection{Sub Section 1}\label{subsystem1_subsystem1subsection1}
Directed graph has directed edges
