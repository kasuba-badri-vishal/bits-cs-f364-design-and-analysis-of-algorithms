.PP
This is a constructor for the \fBGraph1\fP class\&. It is called by passing the number of edges as argument\&.
.PP
### Example 
.PP
.nf
Graph1(int n_edges){
    this->n_edges = n_edges;
}

This is a constructor of \fBGraph1\fP class 
.RE
.PP
\fBAttention:\fP
.RS 4
It is required to specify n_edges 
.RE
.PP
\fBWarning:\fP
.RS 4
There is another constructor with different type, so argument is crucial to call one constructor\&.

.SS "Graph1::Graph1 (set< int > V1)\fC [inline]\fP"

.PP
This is a Constructor for the \fBGraph1\fP class\&. This constructor is called by passing a list of vertices as argument\&. It creates a subGraph1 of the \fBGraph1\fP specified by adj (adjacency list) using a subset of vertices\&.
.PP
### Example 
.PP
.nf
Graph1(set<int> V1){
    V = V1;
    n_edges = 0;
    for(auto x: V){
        for(auto y: adj[x]){
            if(V\&.find(y)!=V\&.end()) n_edges++;
        }
    }
