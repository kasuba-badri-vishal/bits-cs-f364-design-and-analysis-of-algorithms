The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is an algorithm that tackles the max-flow min-cut problem. If a network with vertices and edges between those vertices that have certain weights is given, it gives an answer to how much "flow" the network is capable of processing at a time. 

It was put forth in 1956 by Ford and Fulkerson.

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm assumes that the input will be a graph, along with a source vertex, and a sink vertex.

Time complexity

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, computing max-flow in the network runs in O(mC) time.
m=No. of edges, C=max. flow

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm was eventually improved upon by the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, which does the same thing in O(V2â‹…E) time, independent of the maximum flow value.
